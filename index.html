 <p>Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a father, musician, sleep technologist, and budding web developer!</p>
 <p>I have deeply enjoyed learning to build and style sites, </p>
 <p>I even maintained the websites for a couple of yoga studios for three years!</p>
 <p>but I am also getting a great sense of satisfaction from making them functional!</p>
  <p>The development track here seems like a good fit for me!</p>
